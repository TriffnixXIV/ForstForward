Mechanics:
	- forests now grow all at the same time, instead one after another, during a growth stage
		- this removes some unintuitive and unintended growth behaviour
	- the spread action was reworked:
		- now scales linearly instead of quadratically
		- now tries to plant a specific number of trees instead of planting trees in a range-based pattern
			- this way, spreading is more efficient on edges than before
			- starts at a forest cell, moving away from there
			- tries to distribute the remaining trees equally among the cells at the current distance
				- uses manhattan distance, starting at 1, increnting by 1 if there are trees left to distribute
				- when equal distribution isn't possible, a bit of randomness is used
					- example: spread 7 with 3 adjacent sufficiently growable cells will lead to a 3-2-2, 2-3-2 or 2-2-3 distribution
			- every checked cell that cannot be grown costs 1 tree anyways (also counting invalid ones)
				- this way, spreading in the middle of a vast forest does not necessarily lead to trees being planted on it's edges
	- beer was nerfed:
		- beer level is now subtracted from the villagers amount of actions instead of being calculated into a multiplier
		- beer now scales with time
			- starts at 6, increases by 1 every 12 rounds (reminder: a villager typically has 15 actions)
		- beer still decays exponentially (halfed and rounded down after every round, similar to growth stages)
	- small druid rework:
		- druids now evaluate targets a little differently, so they're ready to move more to get to better spots
			- tiles that aren't forests are valued more highly (+3 instead of the previous +1)
			- tiles that have at least one non-forest directly adjacent to it are valued more highly (+1.5)
		- druids now need at least one forest in their direct vicinity to plant any trees
			- the forest must be within a 3x3 square centered on the druid
			- more mechanical complexity and interplay, yay
