Mechanics:
	- removed the ability to skip a round
	- rain:
		- every second rain growth or rain frost upgrade increases the rate at which rain ticks down
			- example: the upgrade "rain growth boost: 1 -> 2" also increases rain duration tickdown by 1
				- at the end of a round, rain then ticks down by 2 rounds instead of 1
	- lightning:
		- now costs 3 rain per strike instead of in total
		- cost reduction upgrades now occur later
			- first reduction unlocks at lightning level 3, then, the next ones are unlocked every 3rd level

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- fixed: "spawn treantling" occured even when the treantlings were impossible to place
	- fixed: crystals that were unable to spawn before the end of a run were spawning at the beginning of the next run
	- villager count now also updates between plants and spreads
