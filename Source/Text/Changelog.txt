Mechanics:
	- added action upgrades that can be obtained through crystals
		- I will elaborate later
	- removed automatic scaling
	- villager changes:
		- they are now more performant when looking for trees to chop
		- they are now looking for trees up to distance 30 instead of 20
		- now only have 12 actions again
	- druid changes:
		- they evaluate target locations differently once more

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- fixed: treants sometimes softlocked the game when planting themselves
	- fixed: when winning the game through a left-click, the post-game screen was instantly skipped
		- now, a left-click can only skip the post-game screen if it has been there for more than a second
	- maybe fixed: sometimes, villagers were outside of the map, leading to a few possible crashes
		- I think this was due to them also valueing building spots outside of the map, which they now no longer do
	- fixed: rain possibility was not set correctly, leading to a few inefficiencies
	- fixed: pressing two buttons at the same time in the main menu instantly won the game
		- this was due to the first entering the level select and the second starting the game,
			before the map transition even started, leading to the map only having forests, as in the main menu,
			triggering the win condition
		- now, levels can only be started once the map transition is complete

UI:
	- changed the mute button
	- changed the in-game UI
