Mechanics:
	- villagers are now more performant when looking for trees to chop

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- maybe fixed: sometimes, villagers were outside of the map, leading to a few possible crashes
		- I think this was due to them also valueing building spots outside of the map, which they now no longer do
	- fixed: rain possibility was not set correctly, leading to a few inefficiencies
	- fixed: pressing two buttons at the same time in the main menu instantly won the game
		- this was due to the first entering the level select and the second starting the game,
			before the map transition even started, leading to the map only having forests, as in the main menu,
			triggering the win condition
		- now, levels can only be started once the map transition is complete
