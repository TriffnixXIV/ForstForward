Gameplay:
	- removed the ability to skip a round
	- treant
		- added an upgrade that increases actions by 8, but adds a lifespan of  [5 * actions]
		- action upgrades now also increase lifespan by 5x the gained action amount, if a lifespan has been set
		- the death spread upgrades will only occur after the lifespan has been set
		- death spread upgrades now also reduce lifespan by 4 per level
	- treantling:
		- increased the base lifespan from 20 to 24
		- action upgrades now also increase lifespan by 3x the gained action amount
		- removed lifespan upgrades
		- increased the base death spread from 6 to 8
		- death spread upgrades now increase the spread by 12 per level (instead of 8)
		- death spread upgrades now also reduce lifespan by 2 per level
	- druid:
		- now more reluctant to move further, making them more combative when very close to a village
	- rain:
		- every second rain growth or rain frost upgrade increases the rate at which rain ticks down
			- example: the upgrade "rain growth boost: 1 -> 2" also increases rain duration tickdown by 1
				- at the end of a round, rain then ticks down by 2 rounds instead of 1
	- lightning:
		- now costs 3 rain per strike instead of in total
		- cost reduction upgrades now occur later
			- first reduction unlocks at lightning level 3, then, the next ones are unlocked every 3rd level
	- added two new maps: the ring and labyrinth, the first procedurally generated map
