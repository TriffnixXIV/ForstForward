Gameplay:
	- removed the ability to skip a round
	- treantling:
		- increased the base lifespan from 20 to 24
		- action upgrades now also increase lifespan by 3x the gained action amount
		- removed the lifespan upgrade
		- increased the base death spread from 6 to 8
		- increased the death spread upgrade from +8 to +16 per level
		- the death spread upgrade now also reduces lifespan by 2 per level
	- druid:
		- now more reluctant to move further
	- rain:
		- every second rain growth or rain frost upgrade increases the rate at which rain ticks down
			- example: the upgrade "rain growth boost: 1 -> 2" also increases rain duration tickdown by 1
				- at the end of a round, rain then ticks down by 2 rounds instead of 1
	- lightning:
		- now costs 3 rain per strike instead of in total
		- cost reduction upgrades now occur later
			- first reduction unlocks at lightning level 3, then, the next ones are unlocked every 3rd level
	- added two new maps: the ring and labyrinth, the first procedurally generated map

	- fixed: "spawn treantling" occured even when the treantlings were impossible to place
	- fixed: crystals that were unable to spawn before the end of a run were spawning at the beginning of the next run
	- villager count now also updates between plants and spreads
	- score now also updates after a transition is completed

UI:
	- added an in-game-menu when pressing ESC while playing
		- offers the option to resume, reset and quit
