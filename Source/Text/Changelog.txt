Gameplay:
	- villagers:
		- their wood distance map now updates every advancement step (instead of once per round)
		- they now travel along that map instead of looking for specific trees (after a certain distance)
			- this leads to a dramatic performance improvement when there are lots of villagers
		- they now start building sooner when close to a good spot
		- Horst now uses his blast more liberally
	- all beings:
		- now share a base class
		- they now move along their chosen path a little more randomly, instead of going straight and then roughly diagonally

Bug fixes & QoL:
