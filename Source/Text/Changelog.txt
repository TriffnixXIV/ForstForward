Gameplay:
	- advancement steps
		- now occur more on-time than before (every 0.25 seconds, there were some deviations before)
		- most deviations appear to have been slowing advancement steps down, so the game got a little faster
			(some low-accuracy measurements indicate that the previous average step time was about ~0.266 seconds instead)
	- crystals
		- the crystals that are grown by an action are not randomly chosen anymore
		- now, 2 crystal growth is distributed so that as many crystals as possible are completed with the next growth step
			- example: if one crystal is at 5/8 and another at 2/8, the 5er is grown to 7.
			- example 2: if two crystals are at 6/8 and another at 2/8, both 6ers are grown to 7.
				- not to 8, because 1 growth will be given by the next growth step anyways.
			- in other words: as many crystals as possible are brought as close to 7/8 as possible.
	- treant
		- stomping buildings no longer costs actions
		- now only does 6 damage per action per tile, instead of 10
			- this way, treants show some more interesting behaviour
		- simplified target evaluation
	- treantling
		- now prioritizes buildings that are closer to being destroyed
