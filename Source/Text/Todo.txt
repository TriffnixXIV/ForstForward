Mechanics:
	- add sand and water for more map variety (high prio)
		- sand does not allow trees to grow
		- water does not allow trees to grow and costs 4x the movement
	- villagers:
		- make them look less far (~5 instead of 30)
		- when looking for wood, make them travel based on the cell-tree-distance-map, not based on specific target trees
		- update the cell-tree-distance-map every villager step, not only every round
		- when looking for build sites, make them travel based on their home cell until they find a good spot in range
		- make villagers start building sooner when close to a good spot
		- make Horst use his blast more liberally
	- add few distinct generation options for maps
		- separate records for each option
		- "free" option to make all crystals random
		- "normal" normal run, like now (adjusted to have more unique crystal distributions)
		- "hard" more villagers and/or Horsts at start
		- "hard 2" hard + introduce hostile features (see below)
	- add more stuff to villagers
		- more unique villagers with distinct actions
			- unique buildings?
			- necromancer: kills creatures and destroys forests to summon destructive ghouls
				- those then just mow down forests, with a short lifespan
			- child laborers:
				- many of them, spawning from houses occasionally
				- take wood from villagers to build for them
				- have a chance of dying on a build site
		- a crystal equivalent to force the player to choose upgrades for the village
			- unique villager spawns as above
			- village events?
				- festival: villagers are drunk for a short while, then they have more actions than before
				- blood rite: villagers become capable of killing creatures for a short while
	- frost:
		- add upgrade to give houses a chance to crack during high frost amounts
		- add upgrade to give more frost bonus through paying rain
	- druid:
		- rebrand as growth sprite with lifespan (undecided)
			- would make the human vs. nature more clear (druids are the only forest-side humans)
			- would make it more magical
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?

UI:

	- re-order: (undecided)
		- centered map
