Mechanics:
	- druids:
		make pathing more intuitive (they move too far away for too little benefit)
		include power in distance calculation
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- add dedicated treantling stats

UI:
	- change reset record button (high prio)
	- make record sidebar more fancy (high prio)
	- add in-game menu when pressing esc (high prio)
	- add info tab (mid prio)
	- re-order: (undecided)
		- centered map
		- options below
		- forest stats left
		- village stats right
		- common stats top
