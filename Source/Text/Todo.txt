Mechanics:
	- rain:
		- every second rain growth or rain frost upgrade increases the rate at which rain ticks down
			- example: the upgrade "rain growth boost: 1 -> 2" also increases rain duration tickdown by 1
				- at the end of a round, rain then ticks down by 2 rounds instead of 1
	- druids:
		make pathing more intuitive (they move too far away for too little benefit)
		include power in distance calculation
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?
