Mechanics:
	- add sand and water for more map variety (high prio)
		- sand does not allow trees to grow
		- water does not allow trees to grow and costs 4x the movement
	- druid:
		- rebrand as growth sprite with lifespan
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?

Bug fixes & QoL:
	--

UI:
	- add info tab (high prio)
	- make a dedicated Discord (mid prio)
	- add links to main menu (Itch, GitHub, Wiki, Discord)
	- re-order: (undecided)
		- centered map
		- options below
		- forest stats left
		- village stats right
		- common stats top
