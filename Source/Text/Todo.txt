Mechanics:
	- sand and water:
		- maybe add ice as a state of water during high frost (undecided)
	- treants:
		- when mortal, add upgrade to make them spawn treantlings on death
	- treantlings:
		- add upgrade to make them randomly spawn when a forest grows
	- treants & treantlings:
		- make lifespan dependant on rounds, not actions (more understandable)
			- adjust upgrades to only add / reduce lifespan to full rounds, balance accordingly (more impactful)
	- druids:
		- add upgrade to remove dependence on an adjacent forest
		- add upgrade to allow casting on buildings
		- add upgrade to increase damage to buildings
		- rebrand as growth sprite with lifespan (undecided)
			- would make the human vs. nature more clear (druids are the only forest-side humans)
			- would make it more magical
			- growth sprite might be able to take over a villager to become a druid
				- add inquisitor to suss out druids and destroy their homes, killing them
	- growth:
		- add upgrade to make the action also grow crystals
	- frost:
		- add upgrade to give houses a chance to crack during high frost amounts
		- add upgrade to give more frost bonus through paying rain
	- fire (new):
		- burns buildings and trees
		- can be caused by Horst
		- fire crystals?
		- can be stopped by rain, with a chance
	- add few distinct generation options for maps
		- separate records for each option
		- "flex" options to customize the run
			- customizable starting crystals
			- 3+ actions & upgrade options
			- random additional water/forest/sand/plains/house generation
		- "normal" like now (adjusted to have more unique crystal distributions)
		- "hard" more villagers and/or Horsts at start
			- "Horst's Village" as hard option of "Horst's Abode" (?)
		- "hard 2" hard + introduce hostile features (see below)
	- add more stuff to villagers
		- more unique villagers with distinct actions
			- unique buildings?
			- necromancer: kills creatures and destroys forests to summon destructive ghouls
				- those then just mow down forests, with a short lifespan
			- child laborers:
				- many of them, spawning from houses occasionally
				- take wood from villagers to build for them
				- have a chance of dying on a build site
		- a crystal equivalent to force the player to choose upgrades for the village
			- unique villager spawns as above
			- village events?
				- festival: villagers are drunk for a short while, then they have more actions than before
				- blood rite: villagers become capable of killing creatures for a short while
	- add neutral creatures (undecided)
		- birds, deer, rabbits, ...
		- maybe agitatable through some action?
	- add unique win-lose-conditions for some maps (undecided)
		- win when all houses are gone
		- lose when a creature (that does not yet exist) dies
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- achievements

UI:
	- add play button to main menu and level selection
	- add info when hovering stuff (high prio)
	- add info tab (high prio)
	- re-order: (undecided)
		- centered map
		- options below
		- forest stats left
		- village stats right
		- common stats top

Code:
	- make build location finding more efficient
