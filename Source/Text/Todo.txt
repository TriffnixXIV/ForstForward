Mechanics:
	- add sand and water for more map variety (high prio)
		- sand does not allow trees to grow
		- water does not allow trees to grow and costs 4x the movement
	- villagers:
		- make them look less far (~5 instead of 30)
		- when looking for wood, make them travel based on the cell-tree-distance-map, not based on specific target trees
		- update the cell-tree-distance-map every villager step, not only every round
		- when looking for build sites, make them travel based on their home cell until they find a good spot in range
		- make villagers start building sooner when close to a good spot
		- make Horst use his blast more liberally
	- frost:
		- add upgrade to give houses a chance to crack during high frost amounts
		- add upgrade to give more frost bonus through paying rain
	- druid:
		- rebrand as growth sprite with lifespan (undecided)
			- would make the human vs. nature more clear (druids are the only forest-side humans)
			- would make it more magical
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?
