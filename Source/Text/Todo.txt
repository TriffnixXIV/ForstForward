Mechanics:
	- druid changes:
		- make them look further again
		- make them not evaluate based on diagonals anymore
			- more intuitive behavior & evaluation that way?
	- replace beer with more local snowstorms and/or blizzards (high prio)
		- removes actions or increases action cost within a certain area
		- also slows growth (maybe?)
		- more thematic
		- more skill expression through having to position it
		- less of a universal solver
		- can backfire when placed badly
	- add level-specific features to make maps stand out more (high prio)
	- remove skip round, because it trivializes some records (mid prio)
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (undecided)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (undecided)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- bug: treants sometimes softlock the game when planting themselves or otherwise when idle

UI:
	- change reset record button (high prio)
	- make record sidebar more fancy (high prio)
	- add in-game menu when pressing esc (high prio)
	- add info tab (mid prio)
	- re-order: (undecided)
		- centered map
		- options below
		- forest stats left
		- village stats right
		- common stats top
