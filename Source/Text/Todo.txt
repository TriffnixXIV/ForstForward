Mechanics:
	- replace automatic scaling, multiple options: (for v8)
		- action upgrades as actions
		- action upgrades through a upgrade tree
		- action upgrades through upgrade tokens
		- action upgrades through altars
			- rain altar: rain & lightning & beer upgrades
			- life altar: unlocking treants & druid & treant upgrades
			- growth altar: growth, plant & spread upgrades
		- action upgrades through forest enhancements turning into upgrade drops after a delay
	- replace beer with more local snowstorms and/or blizzards (high prio)
		- removes actions or increases action cost within a certain area
		- also slows growth (maybe?)
		- more thematic
		- more skill expression through having to position it
		- less of a universal solver
		- can backfire when placed badly
	- add level-specific features to make maps stand out more (high prio)
	- remove skip round, because it trivializes some records (mid prio)
	- overgrowing houses instead of de-building them (low prio)
		overgrown houses count as forest and need less steps to recover than currently
	- maybe replace weight-based random action generation with deck-like drawable actions (low prio)
		- not that much of a difference at this point?

Bug fixes & QoL:
	-

UI:
	- change InGameUI elements (high prio)
	- change reset record button (high prio)
	- make record sidebar more fancy (high prio)
	- add info tab (mid prio)
	- re-order: (low prio)
		- centered map
		- options below
		- forest stats left
		- village stats right
		- common stats top
