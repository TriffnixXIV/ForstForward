11.1
Gameplay:
	- villagers:
		- basically, all details of their pathing and targeting changed
		- now path way more efficiently by referencing distance maps to get their actions
		- they don't care about their home anymore (subject to change)
		- they don't care specifically about completing incomplete build sites anymore (in comparison to starting a new one)
	- rain
		- the rain growth boost now starts at 1 (instead of 0)
			- this way, rain actually does something by itself without upgrades

11.0
Gameplay:
	- winning:
		- now requires all plains to be covered in forest and all houses to be destroyed
			- sand and water need not be covered
	- sand and water:
		- new tile types
		- trees cannot grow on sand or water
		- houses can't be built on water
		- water cannot be walked on
	- map changes:
		- 3 new maps (stars, the net and oasis)
		- added water to the split and the ring
	- spread:
		- the source cell is now also considered for spread amount usage
			- this way, spreads that don't start on forests will be a bit smaller
			- treantling and treant death spreads have been buffed accordingly
				- treantling start death spread: 8 -> 24
				- trant start death spread: 4x20 -> 4x40
	- villagers:
		- their wood distance map now updates every advancement step (instead of once per round)
		- they now travel along that map instead of looking for specific trees (after a certain distance)
			- this leads to a dramatic performance improvement when there are lots of villagers
		- they now start building sooner when close to a good spot
			- the targeting changes for this lead to a dramatic performance decrease when there are lots of villagers
		- Horst now uses his blast more liberally
	- all beings:
		- now share a base class
		- they now move along their chosen path a little more randomly, instead of going straight and then roughly diagonally

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- added that sound that is absolutely everywhere to a few more places
		- when spawning multiple druids, treantlings or treants, it will now play on every single spawn again
	- added a web build to the itch.io page, so the game can also be played there

UI:
	- added links to the main menu
	- created a dedicated discord (https://discord.gg/CNPbtFGXgh)
