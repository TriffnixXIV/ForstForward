Mechanics:
	- action generation:
		- probabilities of getting an action are now more representative of the weights assigned in code
		- now, actions are generated as if they were drawn from the top of a shuffled deck of cards
			that contains a number of cards of each action equal to their weight,
			redrawing when drawing a duplicate
		- before, to stay with the analogy, the deck was sorted, and two cards were drawn from random places,
			with the second random place necessarily being behind the first one,
			which led to skewed probabilities in favor of actions that were deeper in the deck
			(which were always the same actions, especially: plant, beer and lightning)
		- reordered actions:
			- treant > druid > overgrowth > spread > plant > rain > lightning > beer
				- previous order:
					treant > druid > overgrowth > spread > rain > plant > beer > lightning
			- this only affects the order in which actions are displayed on the action buttons
				- this way, treant will always be the top option, if it occurs,
					and beer always the bottom option, if it occurs
				- previously, it would also have affected the probabilities of getting an action,
					but this was changed (see above)
	- villager changes:
		- pathing and action evaluation has been reworked:
			- villagers are now aware of wood in their immediate vicinity all the time (again)
			- villagers will now always prefer chopping wood that is too close to their home (within 2 tiles)
			- villagers are now more interested in finishing and repairing houses
			- villagers are now more interested in building new houses closer to their home
		- Horst can now unleash a fiery blast to make a sticky situation more manageable for him
			- this blast has a 5 round cooldown and destroys stuff within 3 range
			- when the fire blast is ready, Horst will have fiery sparks with him
	- treant changes:
		- treants now have 8 actions (instead of 6)
		- treants now turn into a bunch of trees when they don't find a build site or house within 20 tiles
			- even though, before doing so, they'll find themselves a nice spot to plant themselves,
				a spot with at least 3 non-forest tiles below them
		- moving outside of forests now does not cost actions anymore
			- before, every tile below the treant that was not a forest made a move cost an extra 0.25 actions
		- it now costs 0.5 actions to stomp a build site and 1 action to stomp a house
			- reminder: creatures can go below 0 actions,
				but will stop acting on following advancement steps if they have 0 or less actions
			- this means that a treant with 1 action can still move and stomp 2 houses doing so,
				which costs 3 actions. this is due to one stomp happening as a part of the movement,
				not as a separate action
			- the stomp at the start of a treants turn phase now also costs actions when destroying build sites or houses
		- this way, they can now traverse more outside of villages
			- like before, a treant starting on 4 tree tiles and moving into 2 houses with each move
				will destroy 6 houses on its turn (cost [0 + 3 + 3 + 3 >= 8], was [0 + 2 + 2 + 2 >= 6] before)
			- a treant starting on 4 house tiles and moving into 2 houses with each move
				will now only destroy 8 houses instead of 10 (cost [4 + 3 + 3 >= 8], was [0 + 2 + 2 + 2 >= 6] before)
			- they are now better at stomping build sites than before
	- druid changes:
		- druids now have 8 actions (instead of 6)
		- this change is supposed to alleviate the cost of them needing trees nearby and being willing to move more
			- those were consequences of the changes made in version 6
	- overgrowth changes:
		- the growth boost now decays to [growth boost / 2], rounded down, instead of [(growth boost / 2) - 1], rounded down
		- this is meant to make growth boosts more stackable and more impactful early in the game
	- spread changes:
		- strength now equals [40 + 4 * current round] instead of [45 + 3 * current round]
	- plant changes:
		- now scales every 5th round (instead of every 7.5th)
			- to be precise, the amount of forests to plant now equals [2 + (current round / 5)], rounded down
		- no longer gets a free extra spread starting in round 20
		- now converts a semi-random number of forests to plant into an extra spread
			- this semi-random number is generated to make plant end up between 4 and 10 forests (inclusive)
				- the only exception is the first 9 rounds of the game, where only 2 or 3 forests can be planted
					- here, none of the forests will be converted
			- the extra spread strength will be [20 * converted forests]
			- example: in round 20, a plant starts with 6 forests. 1 or 2 forests are converted
				into an extra spread of 20 or 40, respectively
			- example 2: in round 80, a plant starts with 18 forests, of which at least 8 and at most 14 are converted,
				leading to a plant between 4 to 10 (inclusive) and a spread between 160 and 280 (inclusive, steps of 20)
				- "plant 4, then spread 280", "plant 7, then spread 220", "plant 10, then spread 160" are 3 of the 7 possible results
		- these changes are supposed to make plant options more diverse
			and decrease the number of clicks needed in later rounds
	- rain changes:
		- now occurs a little more often on higher rain durations than before
			- before, the likelyhood of getting rain decreased by 1 for each 5 rain duration
			- now, the likelyhood decreases by 1 for each multiple of the duration a rain action would currently add
			- example: if rain would give +7, likelyhood of rain decreases by 1 each 7 rain duration
		- rain strength now equals [4 + (current round / 10)], rounded down (instead of [3 + (...)])
		- villagers no longer lose actions during rain
		- this change is supposed to promote the lightning game plan while nerfing rain itself
	- lightning changes:
		- the likelyhood of getting lightning as an option now increases with rain duration
		- the amount of lightning strikes now scales with current rain duration (in addition to villager amount)
			- amount now is the lesser number of [2 + (rain duration / 3)] and [villager amount / 9], rounded down
			- if the amount would be 0, the option wont occur
			- this makes lightning a more viable finisher
		- lightning actions may now also come with rain
			- only occurs when [2 + (rain duration / 3)] is smaller than [villager amount / 9]
			- rain strength in this case equals [3 + (current round / 15)], rounded down

Bug fixes & QoL:
	- maybe fixed: winning through a spread would not stop the run properly
	- maybe fixed: villagers would sometimes not move on the first turn after restarting a run
	- fixed: lightning didn't show its visual
	- navigating only through clicks is now possible
	- the cell highlight now vanishes and shows correctly when not moving the mouse before or after a turn

UI:
	- the mute button is back on screen
	- more stats:
		- max horst amount
		- deaths to treants
		- deaths to lightning
		- cumulative beer level

Visuals:
	- changed the background
	- spread and plant now have a sparkly visual effect
	- changed Horst:
		- his face is now more vibrant and features horns
		- when Horst is able to unleash his fire blast, he will have fiery sparks with him

Sounds:
	- changed the lightning strike SFX
